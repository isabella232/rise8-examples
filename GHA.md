# Advanced GitHub Actions - Tips and Tricks

GitHub Actions is a CI/CD tool that is in active development by GitHub.  Because of this, while it is very easy to get started, it can sometimes be challenging to sift through outdated StackOverflow articles to do a specific thing, if you even know it exists!  While the GitHub Actions documentation is fantastic, you have to know what's there and what's been added since you've looked last.

This post attempts to resolve the issue by existing as a living document that gathers advanced features and explanations all in one place.  Our team follows the GitHub Actions RSS feed to always be looped into the new features coming out.  By knowing what's possible and how to achieve it, your CI/CD workflows will reach their greatest potential :muscle:.
